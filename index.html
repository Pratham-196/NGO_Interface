      <h3>What is an NGO?</h3>
      <p>
        An NGO is an independent, non-profit group formed by people who come together to work
        for social, cultural, environmental, or humanitarian causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike businesses, NGOs don't aim to make profits; instead, they focus on solving
        problems in society and helping people or nature.
